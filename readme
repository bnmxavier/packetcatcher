README:

To run the project you may need to download a library, here is the code to do that
sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-0 libpcap0.8
To get an executable simply type make at the cmd line once you are in the correct directory
then the program can be run with ./psniff [number of packets to capture in int form(zero for infinite)] "[filter args]"
more info on filters here http://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/pcap-filter.7.html
This program must be run with root privileges because it opens a raw socket for packet capture.
Here is an example command and the one I ran the program with most often
sudo ./psniff 0 "ip proto \udp"    The zero tells the program to listen indefinitely,
the ip proto \udp tells the socket to only accept packets with UDP protocols.
I do not know if this will run on mac without issue as I built it on linux, most issues will probably be the result of lack of permissions
